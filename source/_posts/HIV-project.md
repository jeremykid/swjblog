HIV virus's protine order like hexagon. 
In the previous research, they working on the 2 dimension. However, in 3 dimension, the protine fills spherical surface.

This prgramming project is used to help the biology researcher to plot the HIV virus and get a list of all surface protine coordinations by setting the different radius.

## The main structure.
If the point B rotated point A and get point C, I named points A is the father or root of B and C. As I mentioned that HIV virus's surfaces protines order like a hexagen, protine will rotated 120 degree to get another protine. 

There are a K_keepers list of points which generated and a Pivot list of points.

Use a Queue push in the points generated by the other 2 points, and push out the points which is already generated 2 points. When the distance is less than the protine's radius, then the protines should not be placed at that coordination.
