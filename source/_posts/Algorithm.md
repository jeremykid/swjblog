* note0 : Trivial Division use the trivial prime, which cannot use Miller-Rabin primality test
* note1 : Euler's factorization method stops the algorithm
		  when a number cannot found number = a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2. 
		  Miller-Rabin is only judge the prime not find the factors.
* note2 : Since I have not find a better way to find a number = a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2. 
		  So Euler's spend on the this function I will list after that 
* note3 : In Pollards_rho Miller-Rabin primality test, inorder to handle some base cases. I use the 
          trial_division to handle some special cases.

#Integer factorization:

### 1.1
Trial division: (Baseline)
This is a base line in my integer factorization algorithm project. It is using 
a prime sieve for prime number generation which can judge a number is a prime or 
continue do factorization.

Running time: in the worst case it is O(2^(n/2)/((n/2)*ln2)) 
* n is base-2 n digit number.

### 1.2
Euler's factorization method:
This is an implementation factorization algorithm, which solves the following problem. Given an number, then find all prime factors. The base knowledge of Euler's factorization is if 
a number = a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2. There is a quickly way to seperate into 2 factors.

Running time: It is very slow, worst case is greater than trial division,
only quick in some special cases and has potient quick.

### 1.3
Fermat's factorization method:
This is an implementation factorization algorithm, which solves the following problem. Given an number, then find all prime factors. The base knowledge of Fermat's factorization method:
 is if a number = a^2 - b^2 There is a quickly way to seperate into 2 factors.

Running time: Worst case is O(N^{1/2})  
			  General case is O(N^{1/3}) time.

### 1.4
Pollard's rho algorithm:
This is an implementation factorization algorithm, which solves the following problem. Given an number, then find all prime factors. The base knowledge of Pollard's rho algorithm is if a find 
the abs(x^2+1-x) mod N if not 1 then it is a factor of N.

Running time: General case by the Birthday paradox in O(\sqrt p)\ <= O(n^{1/4})
			  but this is a heuristic claim, and rigorous analysis of the algorithm remains open.

3 How to run the code:
------
There is a easy way to run by 
```python runner.py```
Then following the introduction. 

Firstly, you will see this introduction format.
```
integer factorization algorithm
type the number you want to run the algorithm
eg: 1
then will run the Trial division
1.Trial division
2.Euler's factorization method
3.Fermat's factorization method
4.Pollard's rho algorithm 
input the number:
```
Then input the id of factorization method.

for the 3rd and 4th, you also need to choose the id of the prime generate method.
```

Or 

You can runner each single file
which has been listed:

| Fermat's factorization method |fermatfactor_trivial.py  |fermatfactor_improved_prime.py|
| Pollard's rho algorithm 		|Pollards_rho_trivial.py  |Pollards_rho_improved_prime.py|


Anything else you deem relevant.
------
1 I used the trivial prime:
	which judge if a number is a prime.

2 I used another prime test called Miller-Rabin primality test:
	which is much quicker and I have referenced in all my test cases. Prime test is correct.
