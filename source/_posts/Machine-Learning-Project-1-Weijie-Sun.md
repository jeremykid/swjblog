## Introduction

I have taken a Machine Learning Course at the University of Alberta. Our professor is [Russell Greiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Greiner). We need to make a project and do some researches by Machine Learning method with our coach [Koosha Golmohammadi](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~golmoham/). Since this is my first Machine Learning project. Soooo, this is not as good as some projects made by Machine Learning experts. However, we achieve a result is 90% accuracy which is closed to some the U.S agency in Boston.

# 1 Scraping Data.

We scraped some real estate data from real estate data website from Edmonton and marked in Edmonton Map.

# 2 Matching Data

Then we tried to match the real estate data with over 110 features in [Open City Edmonton Data](https://data.edmonton.ca/)

It is a tough work there are different names for an address which is easier for the human to understand than a machine. After a little of the algorithm in nature language process(very basic). 

we got the following useful data.

This is our first step for collating data and scraping data.

I will keep updating for Machine learning. 
See you next time.
